### Introduction

This 14-week protocol is designed to sequentially target mitochondrial health and metabolic function using three interventions: **SS-31**, **MOTS-c**, and **NAD+**. Each compound is introduced in a specific order and timeframe to optimize their individual benefits and exploit potential synergistic effects. The overarching goal is to improve mitochondrial energy production, enhance metabolic health, and promote longevity-related pathways.

### SS-31: Mitochondria-Targeted Peptide (Elamipretide)

SS-31 is a cell-permeable tetrapeptide that selectively concentrates in the inner mitochondrial membrane by binding to **cardiolipin**, a unique phospholipid critical for electron transport chain (ETC) function. By stabilizing ETC supercomplexes, SS-31 improves electron transfer efficiency and preserves ATP production while minimizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

**Key mechanisms:**
- Scavenges mitochondrial ROS and prevents oxidative damage
- Improves mitochondrial bioenergetics by modulating cytochrome c–cardiolipin interactions
- Inhibits opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)
- Enhances organ function in aging: 8 weeks of SS-31 in aged mice improved cardiac diastolic function and reduced oxidative stress to youthful levels

SS-31 is given during **weeks 3–8** (a 6-week window), as prolonged use beyond 4 weeks has not been formally studied in humans. This timeframe aligns with animal studies (4–8 weeks) that achieved significant mitochondrial improvements.

---

### MOTS-c: Mitochondrial-Derived Peptide

MOTS-c is a 16-amino acid peptide encoded in mitochondrial DNA (12S rRNA gene) that functions as a signaling molecule linking mitochondrial status to nuclear metabolism.

**Key mechanisms:**
- **AMPK activation**: Interferes with the folate cycle, causing AICAR accumulation that activates AMPK — a master energy sensor enhancing glucose uptake, fatty-acid oxidation, and mitochondrial biogenesis
- **Nuclear gene regulation**: Translocates to the nucleus to regulate genes involved in metabolism and proteostasis
- **NAD+ elevation**: Raises intracellular NAD+ levels and acts via SIRT1 to exert metabolic effects
- **Anti-inflammatory action**: Reduces IL-6 levels and enhances antioxidant responses via Nrf2 activation

In animal studies, MOTS-c prevented obesity and insulin resistance in mice on high-fat diets. In older mice, intermittent MOTS-c (5 mg/kg thrice weekly) significantly enhanced physical performance and delayed age-related frailty. MOTS-c levels naturally decline ~20% with aging, making supplementation a compelling strategy.

MOTS-c is introduced during **weeks 9–14** after SS-31 has repaired the mitochondrial machinery, allowing cells to fully capitalize on MOTS-c's metabolic activation.

---

### NAD+ Supplementation: The Metabolic Backbone

NAD+ is a vital coenzyme acting as an electron carrier in redox reactions and a substrate for signaling enzymes (sirtuins, PARPs). NAD+ levels diminish with age due to reduced synthesis and increased consumption, leading to metabolic sluggishness and impaired DNA repair.

**Supplementation benefits:**
- Activates sirtuin enzymes (SIRT1, SIRT3) that regulate energy metabolism and genomic stability
- Improves mitochondrial function via SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of metabolic enzymes
- Enhances mental clarity, energy levels, and brain function
- Supports DNA repair mechanisms

**Dosage escalation rationale:**
- **Weeks 1–2**: 25 mg twice/week — allows acclimation and avoids side effects (flushing, nausea)
- **Weeks 3–4**: 50 mg twice/week — gradual increase as tolerance builds
- **Weeks 5–14**: 100 mg twice/week — therapeutic plateau maintained throughout

NAD+ is the only component spanning all 14 weeks, providing continuous metabolic support for both SS-31 and MOTS-c phases.

---

### The Three-Phase Sequential Strategy

**Phase 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1–2): NAD+ Loading**
Elevating NAD+ ensures cells have ample metabolic cofactor availability and activated sirtuin pathways from the outset. This "fuel priming" readies mitochondria for improvement.

**Phase 2 — Mitochondrial Repair (Weeks 3–8): SS-31 + NAD+**
With NAD+-dependent enzymes already more active, SS-31 directly targets mitochondria to reduce ROS and stabilize ETC function. Research in aged mice showed combined NAD+ and SS-31 treatment produced a **synergistic rejuvenating effect** on heart metabolism that exceeded either compound alone.

**Phase 3 — Metabolic Enhancement (Weeks 9–14): MOTS-c + NAD+**
After mitochondria have been revitalized by SS-31, MOTS-c activates AMPK to push the system to higher performance. The AMPK–SIRT1 positive feedback loop is amplified by maintained NAD+ levels, driving improvements in glucose handling, insulin sensitivity, and physical endurance.

---

### Synergistic Effects

**SS-31 + NAD+ (Mitochondrial Synergy)**
SS-31 preserves ETC function while NAD+ provides NADH fuel. Because SS-31 reduces oxidative damage, less NAD+ is diverted to PARP enzymes for DNA repair, conserving NAD+ pools for productive metabolism. Combined treatment in aged hearts restored youthful energy dynamics better than either alone.

**MOTS-c + NAD+ (Metabolic Synergy)**
MOTS-c triggers AMPK, AMPK boosts NAD+ via NAMPT upregulation, and high NAD+ activates sirtuins that complement AMPK effects. With NAD+ already elevated, SIRT1 is primed when MOTS-c arrives — producing stronger metabolic effects than MOTS-c alone.

**SS-31 → MOTS-c (Sequential Complementarity)**
By improving mitochondrial capacity first, SS-31 enhances responsiveness to MOTS-c's metabolic demands. When AMPK activation increases energy requirements, repaired mitochondria can meet that demand with higher efficiency and resilience.

---

### Why This Sequence Matters

The order **NAD+ → SS-31 → MOTS-c** follows a logical progression: first repair the engine (mitochondria), then step on the gas pedal (AMPK/metabolic activation). An alternate sequence — activating metabolism before repairing mitochondria — would be like revving a broken engine, potentially producing excess ROS without achieving desired energy output.

All three interventions together target the **"mitochondrial triangle" of healthy aging**: mitochondrial function, metabolic signaling, and cellular maintenance. The expected result is a multiplicative effect where combined treatment best recapitulates youthful metabolic states.

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Sequential approach** avoids overloading the body and allows each compound's effects to unfold fully
2. **NAD+ dose escalation** ensures safety, tolerance, and optimal utilization
3. **SS-31's 6-week window** captures mitochondrial benefits within prudent safety margins
4. **MOTS-c after SS-31** leverages repaired mitochondria for maximum metabolic enhancement
5. **Combined synergies** produce greater results than any single intervention alone
